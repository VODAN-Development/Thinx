# AI Smart Mapper Guide for Researchers

## What Is This?

The **AI Smart Mapper** is a tool that automatically organizes your data columns so they match Thinx's standard format (the Common Data Model). Instead of manually renaming dozens of columns, the AI does it for you in seconds.

### Why Would I Use This?

**The Problem:** Your interview data might have columns like:
- `"name_of_victim"`, `"victim name"`, `"Name"`, `"respondent_name"`

**But Thinx expects:** `Victim.name`

**The Solution:** The AI reads your column names, understands what they mean, and suggests the correct standard names. This saves hours of tedious work!

### Real-World Example

**Your data (before):**
```
age | gender | country | trafficker_name | incident_date
27  | Male   | Eritrea | John Smith      | 2023-05-15
```

**AI suggestions:**
- `age` → `Victim.age`
- `gender` → `Victim.gender`
- `country` → `Victim.nationality`
- `trafficker_name` → `Trafficker.name`
- `incident_date` → `Incident.date`

**Click "Apply" and your data is ready to use!**

---

## How It Works (Simple Explanation)

Think of the AI as a smart assistant that:

1. **Reads** your column names (e.g., "age", "victim_gender", "nationality")
2. **Compares** them to Thinx's standard format
3. **Suggests** the best match (e.g., "age" → "Victim.age")
4. **Applies** the renaming when you approve

### 🔒 Privacy & Security

**Important:** The AI runs **entirely on your computer** (or your organization's server). Your sensitive research data:
- ✅ Never leaves your system
- ✅ Never goes to the internet
- ✅ Never touches external AI services like ChatGPT or Claude
- ✅ Is GDPR compliant by design

This is called "local AI" or "on-premise AI" - the model runs in a Docker container on your own hardware.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure:
- ✅ Thinx is running with `--profile full` (includes the AI)
- ✅ You have at least 2GB free disk space (for AI model)
- ✅ You have a data file ready (Excel or CSV format)

**Not sure if AI is enabled?** When you started Thinx, you should have used:
```bash
docker-compose --profile full up --build
```

### Step 1: Check if AI Is Available

1. Open Thinx at http://localhost
2. Upload a data file (or use test data from `Mock data/` folder)
3. Go to **Step 3: Schema & Validation**
4. Look for the **"AI Smart Mapper"** section

**✅ If you see it:** Great! Continue to Step 2.

**❌ If you don't see it:**
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
docker ps

# Look for a container with "ollama" in the name
# If not there, restart with full profile:
docker-compose --profile full up -d
```

### Step 2: Download an AI Model

**What is a "model"?** Think of it like downloading a brain for the AI. Different models have different:
- **Size** (how much disk space they need)
- **Speed** (how fast they process)
- **Accuracy** (how good their suggestions are)

#### 🎯 Which Model Should I Choose?

**For most researchers, we recommend:** `llama3.2`

| Model Name | Size | Speed | Accuracy | Best For |
|-----------|------|-------|----------|----------|
| **llama3.2** ⭐ | 2GB | Fast | Good | **Start here** - best balance |
| **phi3** | 2.3GB | Very Fast | Good | Older computers |
| **mistral** | 4GB | Medium | Excellent | Better results needed |
| **gemma2:2b** | 1.6GB | Very Fast | Decent | Quick testing |
| **llama3:8b** | 4.7GB | Slow | Excellent | Maximum accuracy |

**💡 Recommendation:** If this is your first time, choose **llama3.2**. It's the sweet spot between size, speed, and quality.

#### How to Download (Using the Interface)

1. In **Step 3: Schema & Validation**, find the **"Download New Model"** section
2. In the text box, type: `llama3.2`
3. Click the **"Download"** button
4. **Wait patiently** - you'll see a progress message
   - ⏱️ This takes 5-15 minutes (downloading 2GB file)
   - ☕ Good time for a coffee break!
5. When complete, you'll see: ✅ "Model downloaded successfully"
6. Click **"Refresh"** - your model now appears in the dropdown

**💡 Tip:** The download only happens once. After that, the model is saved and ready to use instantly.

#### Alternative: Download via Command Line (Advanced)

If you prefer using the terminal:

```bash
# For Docker setup
docker exec -it ollama_service ollama pull llama3.2

# For local Ollama installation
ollama pull llama3.2
```

### Step 3: Upload Your Data

1. Go to **Step 2: Upload Data**
2. Click **"Choose File"** or drag-and-drop
3. Select your Excel or CSV file
4. Click **"Upload"**
5. Wait for confirmation: ✅ "File uploaded successfully"

**What file formats work?**
- ✅ `.xlsx` (Excel)
- ✅ `.csv` (Comma-separated values)
- ✅ `.json` (Advanced users)

### Step 4: Run the AI Mapper

1. Go to **Step 3: Schema & Validation**
2. Find the **"AI Smart Mapper"** section
3. Click the **dropdown menu** and select your model (e.g., `llama3.2`)
4. Click **"Suggest Mappings"**
5. **Wait 30-60 seconds** while the AI analyzes your data
   - You'll see a loading spinner
   - The AI is reading your column names and comparing them to the standard format
6. **Review the suggestions** in the table that appears

### Step 5: Review and Apply Suggestions

The AI will show a table like this:

| Your Column Name | AI Suggestion | Confidence |
|-----------------|---------------|------------|
| `age` | `Victim.age` | ✅ High |
| `victim_gender` | `Victim.gender` | ✅ High |
| `nationality` | `Victim.nationality` | ✅ High |
| `trafficker_name` | `Trafficker.name` | ⚠️ Medium |

**What to check:**
- ✅ **Green/High confidence:** Usually correct, safe to accept
- ⚠️ **Yellow/Medium confidence:** Double-check these
- ❌ **Red/Low confidence:** Review carefully or skip

**To apply the changes:**
1. Click **"Apply Mapping to File"** at the bottom
2. Your file is automatically restructured
3. You'll see: ✅ "Mappings applied successfully"
4. Continue to the next step in the workflow

## Understanding AI Mapping Results

When the AI finishes, you'll see a detailed breakdown of its suggestions.

### Interpreting the Output

The AI provides three pieces of information for each column:

1. **Your Original Column Name** - What you called it
2. **Suggested Mapping** - What it should be called in Thinx's format
3. **Confidence Level** - How sure the AI is

### Confidence Levels Explained

| Level | What It Means | What You Should Do |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| **✅ High (80-100%)** | AI is very confident | Usually safe to accept |
| **⚠️ Medium (50-79%)** | AI thinks it's probably right | Review carefully |
| **❌ Low (0-49%)** | AI is guessing | Double-check or manually assign |

### Common Mapping Patterns

The AI recognizes these common patterns:

**Victim Information:**
- `age`, `victim_age`, `Age` → `Victim.age`
- `gender`, `sex`, `victim_gender` → `Victim.gender`
- `nationality`, `country`, `origin` → `Victim.nationality`
- `name`, `victim_name`, `respondent` → `Victim.name`

**Trafficker Information:**
- `trafficker`, `trafficker_name`, `perpetrator` → `Trafficker.name`
- `trafficker_nationality`, `trafficker_country` → `Trafficker.nationality`

**Incident Information:**
- `incident_date`, `date`, `occurrence_date` → `Incident.date`
- `incident_type`, `crime_type`, `abuse_type` → `Incident.type`
- `description`, `incident_description`, `details` → `Incident.description`

**Location Information:**
- `location`, `place`, `border` → `Location.name`
- `location_description`, `place_details` → `Location.description`

### Example Output

```text
Column Mapping Results:
----------------------
Original Column: "age"
Suggested Mapping: "Victim.age"
Confidence: 95% ✅ High

Original Column: "gender of victim"
Suggested Mapping: "Victim.gender"
Confidence: 90% ✅ High

Original Column: "country"
Suggested Mapping: "Victim.nationality"
Confidence: 65% ⚠️ Medium
(Note: Could also be trafficker nationality - please verify)

Original Column: "date"
Suggested Mapping: "Incident.date"
Confidence: 45% ❌ Low
(Note: Ambiguous - could be interview date or incident date)
```
  "victim_id": "victim_id",
  "name": "victim_name", 
  "age": "victim_age",
  "nationality": "victim_nationality",
  "unknown_column": null
}
```

- **Keys**: Your original column names
- **Values**: Suggested CDM field names
- **null**: No good match found (column will be skipped)

### CDM Fields

The Common Data Model includes fields across several entities:

**Victim Fields:**
- `victim_id`, `victim_name`, `victim_age`, `victim_gender`
- `victim_nationality`, `victim_education_level`
- Sensitive: `victim_ethnicity`, `victim_religion`

**Trafficker Fields:**
- `trafficker_id`, `trafficker_name`, `trafficker_gender`
- `trafficker_nationality`, `trafficker_age`

**Incident Fields:**
- `incident_id`, `incident_date`, `incident_location`
- `incident_type`, `border_crossed`

**Exploitation Fields:**
- `exploitation_type`, `duration_days`, `labor_hours_per_day`
- `physical_abuse`, `psychological_abuse`

See `hds_cdm.ttl` for the complete schema definition.

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Descriptive Column Names

The AI works better with clear column names:

✅ **Good**: `victim_age`, `date_of_birth`, `country_of_origin`  
❌ **Poor**: `col1`, `data`, `field_x`

### 2. Review Before Applying

Always review the AI's suggestions before applying them. The AI may:
- Misinterpret ambiguous column names
- Map similar-sounding but semantically different fields
- Miss domain-specific terminology

### 3. Choose the Right Model

- **Start with llama3.2**: Good balance of speed and accuracy
- **Use larger models** if mappings are poor
- **Consider phi3** for faster processing on limited hardware

### 4. Pre-clean Your Data

For best results:
- Ensure column names are in English
- Remove special characters from headers
- Use consistent naming conventions

## Troubleshooting

### "AI service unavailable"

**Problem**: Ollama container is not running

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check if Ollama is running
docker ps | grep ollama

# Start with full profile
docker-compose --profile full up -d ollama

# Check Ollama logs
docker logs ollama
```

### "No models found"

**Problem**: No models downloaded yet

**Solution**: Download a model using the UI or terminal (see Step 2 above)

### "Model download failed"

**Possible causes**:
- No internet connection
- Invalid model name
- Insufficient disk space
- Ollama service not responding

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check Ollama status
docker exec -it ollama ollama list

# Verify connectivity
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# Check disk space
df -h
```

### "Mapping took too long / timed out"

**Problem**: Large models or many columns can take time

**Solutions**:
- Use a smaller model (phi3, gemma2:2b)
- Reduce the number of columns in your file
- Increase timeout in `backend/utils/ai_mapper.py`

### Poor Mapping Quality

**If mappings are incorrect**:
1. Try a larger model (llama3:8b, mistral)
2. Rename ambiguous columns in your source file
3. Manually adjust the mappings after AI suggestion
4. Consider mapping manually for critical fields

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Ollama Host

If running Ollama on a different host:

```python
# In backend/utils/ai_mapper.py
mapper = SmartMapper(host='http://your-ollama-host:11434')
```

Or set environment variable:
```bash
export OLLAMA_HOST=http://your-ollama-host:11434
```

### Adjusting the Prompt

The mapping prompt is in `backend/utils/ai_mapper.py`:

```python
def _build_prompt(self, source_columns, target_schema):
    return f"""
    You are a data integration expert. Map the source columns to the target schema fields.
    
    Source Columns: {json.dumps(source_columns)}
    
    Target Schema (Common Data Model):
    {json.dumps(target_schema)}
    
    Return a JSON object where keys are Source Columns and values are the best matching Target Schema field.
    If no good match exists, map to null.
    """
```

You can modify this to:
- Add examples
- Specify domain context
- Include mapping rules

### Custom Models

You can use any model from Ollama's library:

```bash
# Vision models (if you need image analysis)
ollama pull llava

# Code-focused models
ollama pull codellama

# Multilingual models
ollama pull aya
```

## Privacy & Security

### Data Privacy

✅ **Local Processing**: All AI processing happens locally  
✅ **No External Calls**: Data never leaves your infrastructure  
✅ **GDPR Compliant**: Suitable for sensitive human trafficking data

### Model Source

- All models are open-source
- Downloaded from Ollama's official library
- Can be audited and verified

### Security Considerations

- Models run in isolated Docker containers
- No internet access required after download
- Logging can be disabled for sensitive operations

## Performance Tips

1. **Model Selection**: Smaller models (2-3GB) are usually sufficient for mapping tasks
2. **Batch Processing**: Process multiple files with the same model to avoid re-loading
3. **Resource Allocation**: Allocate at least 4GB RAM to the Ollama container for smooth operation
4. **SSD Storage**: Store models on SSD for faster loading

## Future Enhancements

Planned features:
- [ ] Model download progress indicator
- [ ] Confidence scores for each mapping
- [ ] Batch mapping across multiple files
- [ ] Custom mapping rules/templates
- [ ] Fine-tuning on domain-specific data
